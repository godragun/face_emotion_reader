# Face Emotion Reader

Face Emotion Reader is a project designed to detect and classify human emotions based on facial expressions. This repository contains all the necessary code, models, and documentation to get started with facial emotion recognition using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Detect faces in images or video streams
- Classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc.
- Easy-to-use interface
- Modular and extensible codebase
- Support for real-time emotion recognition

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/godragun/face_emotion_reader.git
   cd face_emotion_reader
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Download or prepare the pre-trained models as described in the documentation.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To run the emotion reader on an image:

```bash
python main.py --image path_to_image.jpg
```

To use a webcam for real-time emotion detection:

```bash
python main.py --webcam
```

### Configuration

- Modify configuration settings in `config.py` as needed.
- You can change the emotion classes, model parameters, and input sources.
